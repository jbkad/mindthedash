# Mind the Dash

> A real-time UK train platform finder — before it hits the boards.

**Mind the Dash** is a web application built to make commuting smoother by showing UK train departure platforms before they appear on the station board. No more last-minute dashes — just reliable, real-time platform info.

Built with **React + TypeScript**, **FastAPI**, and the **Darwin Webservice Live Departues API**.
